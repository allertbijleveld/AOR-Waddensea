## Data explanantion
Occupancy was calculated as the sum of the total number of presences divided by the number of sampling stations visited. Abundance (n m-2) and biomass (g AFDM m-2) were calculated within occupied patches only. The regional data are species-specific values averaged accross the entire Dutch Wadden Sea, and local data represent averages within years and tidal basins. Values preceded by 't_' represent transformed values. See the original paper for more details.
